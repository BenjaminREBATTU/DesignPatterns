#Design Pattern Factory

#####Family: creational pattern

This Design Pattern is one of the best way to create objects dynamically.
It allows to create some objects, member from a same set of subclass, whose the type will depend on the context.

There are two way to do this Design Pattern:
* Create an abstract factory and let one of its subclass create a specific object.
* Define a concrete Factory that will handle all the process. The Factory need a method with params that inform on the Object Type to create.
